# Unsupervised-Learning-on-Iris-Dataset-K-Means-Hierarchical-Clustering

📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques — specifically K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering — applied to the classic Iris dataset.

The goal of this project is to discover natural groupings (clusters) in the data without using any labels (species). By analyzing the relationships among flower features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, we aim to visualize how unsupervised models identify patterns hidden within the dataset.

🧠 Objective

To perform clustering analysis on the Iris dataset using:

K-Means Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative Clustering)

and visualize how well these algorithms separate the species based purely on features.

📊 Dataset Description

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of flowers from three species:

Iris-setosa

Iris-versicolor

Iris-virginica

🔹 Features Used:

| Feature        | Description                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `sepal_length` | Length of the sepal in cm                        |
| `sepal_width`  | Width of the sepal in cm                         |
| `petal_length` | Length of the petal in cm                        |
| `petal_width`  | Width of the petal in cm                         |
| `species`      | Actual flower species (used only for validation) |
